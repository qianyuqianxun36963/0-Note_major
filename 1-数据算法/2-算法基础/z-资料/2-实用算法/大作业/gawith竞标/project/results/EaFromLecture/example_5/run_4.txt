// A solution conaints schedules for one or multiple cars.
// A car schedule is a list of order IDs and it tells the cars what to do.

// A car can do three things: drive to a location, pick up an order, and deliver/unload an order.
// An order ID can occur two times in a car schedule:
//  1. The first time an order ID occurs, the car drives to the order's pick-up location (if it is not already there) and picks up the order.
//  2. The second time an order ID occurs, the car drives to the order's delivery location (if it is not already there) and unloads/delivers the order.
// Of course, a car can load multiple orders at the same time, if its capacity allows for this.
// If a car drives somewhere, it will take all the orders it has loaded along with it.
//
// Example. 1: 3 4 4 5 3 5
// Meaning: Car 1 drives to the pick-up location of order 3, picks the order up, the travels to the pick-up location of order 4 and loads it as well. It will then drive to the delivery location of order 4 and unload it. Next it travels to the pick-up location of order 5, loads that order and then drives to the delivery location of order 3 and delivers order 3. Finally, it will drive to the delivery location of order 5 and deliver order 5.
//
// If an order ID occurs more than two times in one car schedule or the order has already been delivered or loaded by another car, its occurence will be ignored.
// If an order ID occurs only one time in a car schedule, this means that the order would be loaded into the car but never unloaded and never delivered.
// Orders occuring not in the schedule are ignored.
// There is a penalty of 1000000000 per order which was picked-up but not delivered.
// If the vehicle's capacity is exceeded, this will also result in a penalty of 1000000000 per violation.

// The goal is to find solutions that allow our 'company' to correctly complete its work as quickly as possible.
// This means that all orders should be delivered and all cars must be back in the depot.
// Any problem can be solved by using single car, but of course, by using more cars we can finish the work faster.
